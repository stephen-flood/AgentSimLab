    servers are and how they relate to agents.


    Here''s the updated plan:


    1.  **Get the URL summary for the most promising link.** From the previous results,
    "https://stytch.com/blog/model-context-protocol-introduction/" seems like a good
    starting point. I will use the `get_url_summary` tool to get a summary of its
    contents.

    2.  **Analyze the summary.** I''ll carefully read the summary to identify key
    concepts, definitions, and use cases related to MCP servers and their connection
    to agents.

    3.  **Iterate if needed.** If the first summary is insufficient, I will try a
    second promising link from the previous search results.


    Let''s start by getting the summary of the first link.

- Observation: "```yaml\nsummary: |\n  The Stytch blog post provides a comprehensive\
    \ introduction to the Model Context Protocol (MCP),\n  an open standard designed\
    \ to facilitate interaction between AI models and external data/services.\n\n\
    \  **Key Concepts:**\n  *   MCP is a universal adapter that allows AI models (especially\
    \ LLMs) to make structured API calls securely.\n  *   It uses a client-server\
    \ architecture: AI apps run an MCP client, while integrations use MCP servers.\n\
    \  *   MCP aims to standardize how AI agents discover and utilize external tools\
    \ and data, reducing the need for custom integrations.\n  *   It promotes consistent\
    \ request/response formats via JSON-RPC, and it supports two-way context with\
    \ ongoing dialogue, predefined prompts, and structured data.\n  *   OAuth 2.0\
    \ support was added to MCP for authentication.\n\n  **Comparison to Alternatives:**\n\
    \  *   MCP is contrasted with custom API integrations, ChatGPT plugins, and LLM\
    \ tool frameworks like LangChain.\n  *   MCP offers advantages, including rapid\
    \ tool integration, better security (OAuth support), and more versatile interaction\
    \ types.\n\n  **Use Cases:**\n  *   AI-powered chatbots that access external information\n\
    \  *   Automated AI workflows that integrate external systems and data\n  *  \
    \ AI coding assistants\n\n  **MCP Architecture:**\n\n  *   MCP Client: Embedded\
    \ in AI applications (e.g. chatbots).\n  *   MCP Server: Exposes external data/tools.\n\
    \  *   Interaction occurs through standardized JSON-RPC messages\n\n  **Building\
    \ and Deploying MCP servers**\n  *   Developers can use programming languages\
    \ that can print to stdout or serve an HTTP endpoint.\n\n  **MCP clients and tools**\n\
    \  *   MCP clients can be built using programming languages and frameworks, such\
    \ as Python, JavaScript, or Java.\n  *   These clients can be integrated with\
    \ MCP servers to enable features such as data processing, AI model management,\
    \ or tool integration.\n\n  **Limitations:**\n  *   Early versions lacked standardized\
    \ authentication, which was later addressed with OAuth 2.0.\n```"
- Plan: 'Okay, I''ve learned from the previous steps that MCP (Model Context Protocol)
    is an open standard that facilitates interaction between AI models and external
    data/services. It acts as a universal adapter, enabling AI models to securely
    make structured API calls. The architecture involves MCP clients (embedded in
    AI apps) and MCP servers (exposing external data/tools) communicating through
    standardized JSON-RPC messages. OAuth 2.0 support has been added for authentication.


    Now I need to expand my understanding by exploring more sources to write a detailed
    final report.


    Here''s the updated plan:


    1.  **Search for more comprehensive resources on MCP.** Use `web_search` to find
    more in-depth articles, specifications, or documentation related to MCP servers
    and their integration with AI agents. Focus on technical details, security aspects,
    and practical implementation examples.

    2.  **Summarize key findings from multiple sources.** After getting a list of
    URLs, I''ll use `get_url_summary` on a couple of them, focusing on different aspects
    to create a well-rounded view.

    3.  **Synthesize a one-page final report.** Based on the collected information,
    I will write a detailed report about Agents and MCP servers, describing the key
    concepts, architecture, benefits, limitations, and use cases.


    Let''s start with searching for more resources.

    Now I need to synthesize this information into a comprehensive one-page report.


    Here''s my plan:


    1.  **Identify Key Themes:** Group the limitations into broader categories (e.g.,
    Security, Reliability, Usability).

    2.  **Prioritize Limitations:** Focus on the most critical and frequently mentioned
    limitations.

    3.  **Synthesize Summaries:** Combine the information from the different summaries

    \ AI assistants to interact with external tools\n    and services on behalf of\

    \ for AI systems to access various digital tools, it introduces significant\n\
    \    security vulnerabilities.\n  mcp_functionality:\n    - MCP acts as an intermediary\
    \ between AI assistants and services, interpreting user\n      requests and communicating\
    \ with MCP servers to execute them.\n    - Example: Setting up MCP for Gmail involves\
    \ installing and configuring an MCP\n      server, authenticating to Gmail through\
    \ OAuth, and securely storing the OAuth\n      token.\n  security_risks:\n   \
    \ token_theft_account_takeover:\n      - If an attacker steals the OAuth token\
    \ stored by the MCP server, they can access\n        the victim's entire email\
    \ history, send emails as the victim, delete communications,\n        execute\
    \ data exfiltration, and monitor communications.\n      - Detection is difficult\
    \ because using a stolen token through MCP may appear as\n        legitimate API\

    \ attackers access to all connected service tokens\n        (e.g., Gmail, Google\
    \ Drive, Calendar).\n      - Attackers can execute actions across these services,\
    \ access corporate resources,\n        and maintain persistent access even if\

    The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard designed to enable AI assistants
    to interact with external tools and services. While MCP aims to provide a universal
    interface for AI systems, it introduces significant security vulnerabilities.


    **Key Security Risks:**


    *   **Token Theft and Account Takeover:** MCP servers store OAuth tokens, which,
    if stolen, can grant attackers access to a user''s entire email history, the ability
    to send emails as the victim, delete communications, execute data exfiltration,
    and monitor communications. Detection is difficult because using a stolen token
    through MCP may appear as legitimate API access.


    *   **MCP Server Compromise:** Breaching an MCP server grants attackers access
    to all connected service tokens (e.g., Gmail, Google Drive, Calendar). Attackers
    can execute actions across these services, access corporate resources, and maintain
    persistent access even if the user changes their password.


    *   **Prompt Injection Attacks:** Attackers can craft malicious messages with
    hidden instructions that, when shared with an AI assistant, trigger unauthorized
    MCP actions.


    *   **Excessive Permission Scope and Data Aggregation:** MCP servers often request
    broad permission scopes, creating privacy and security risks. Centralization of
    multiple service tokens leads to data aggregation potential, enabling correlation
    attacks across services. Even legitimate MCP operators could mine user data for
    commercial purposes.


    **Recommendations:**


    *   Robust security standards specifically designed for MCP implementations are
    needed.

    *   Implement fine-grained permission models to limit access to only what is necessary.

    *   Advanced monitoring and anomaly detection for MCP server activity.

    *   Protection against prompt injection and other AI-specific attack vectors.

    *   Clear user education about the risks and responsibilities of using MCP-enabled
    assistants.


    **Conclusion:**


    MCP introduces several security risks that need to be addressed before widespread
    adoption. Focusing on robust security standards, fine-grained permissions, and
    proactive threat detection is crucial to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

- Plan: 'Okay, I understand the objective. I need to research Model Context Protocol
    (MCP) servers and provide a detailed report. Here''s the plan:


    1.  **Search for introductory information on MCP servers:** Use a broad search
    query to understand the basic concepts, purpose, and benefits of MCP.

    2.  **Identify authoritative sources:** Look for blog posts, documentation, or
    libraries from major AI labs or companies involved in AI development.

    3.  **Search for setup instructions and examples:** Use specific search queries
    to find guides and code examples for setting up an MCP server, including a minimal
    "Hello World" example.

    4.  **Summarize and report:** Compile the findings into a one-page report, including
    the information on MCP servers, their benefits, setup steps, and a "Hello World"
    code example.


    Now, let''s take the first step. I will use the `web_search` tool to search for
    introductory information.

    Here''s the plan:


    1. **Prioritize URLs:** From the list of URLs, identify the ones that seem most
    likely to contain setup instructions and examples (e.g., those with "quickstart"
    or "introduction" in the title).

    2. **Get URL Summaries:** Use the `get_url_summary` tool to get summaries of the
    most promising URLs.

    3. **Analyze Summaries:** Review the summaries to identify the key steps and concepts
    involved in setting up an MCP server and note any potential "Hello World" examples.

    4. **Refine Search (if needed):** If the summaries don''t provide enough detail,
    I will refine my search query to focus on specific aspects of MCP server setup.

    5. **Compile Report:** Once I have enough information, I will compile a one-page
    report summarizing my findings, including the benefits, setup steps, and a "Hello
    World" code example.


    I will start by prioritizing the URLs and getting summaries of the top candidates.

    \ I need to create a simpler \"Hello World\" example and compile all the information\
    \ into a report.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1.  **Simplify the Weather Example:**\
    \ Adapt the weather server example from the quickstart guide to create a minimal\
    \ \"Hello World\" MCP server. This will involve removing the weather-related code\
    \ and replacing it with a simple function that returns \"Hello, world!\".\n2.\
    \  **Create Report:** Compile the findings into a one-page report, including a\
    \ description of MCP servers, the problems they solve, the steps to set up a server,\
    \ and the \"Hello World\" code example.\n\nNow, let's create the report.\n\n**Model\
    \ Context Protocol (MCP) Server Report**\n\n**What is MCP?**\n\nModel Context\
    \ Protocol (MCP) is a protocol that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact\
    \ with external tools and resources. It allows developers to extend the capabilities\
    \ of LLMs by providing them with access to real-time data, specialized functions,\
    \ and other external services.\n\n**Problems MCP Solves**\n\n*   **Limited Knowledge:**\
    \ LLMs have a limited understanding of the real world. MCP allows them to access\
    \ up-to-date information and domain-specific knowledge.\n*   **Lack of Functionality:**\
    \ LLMs are primarily text-based models. MCP enables them to perform actions and\
    \ interact with systems beyond text generation.\n*   **Static Context:** LLMs\
    \ typically operate within a static context. MCP allows them to dynamically adjust\
    \ their behavior based on real-time information and user input.\n\n**Steps to\
    \ Set Up an MCP Server**\n\n1.  **Prerequisites:**\n    *   Python 3.10 or higher\n\
    \    *   MCP SDK (version 1.2.0 or higher)\n2.  **Set up the environment:**\n\n\
    ```bash\nuv init hello_world\ncd hello_world\nuv venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n\
    uv add \"mcp[cli]\"\ntouch hello_world.py\n```\n\n3.  **Initialize FastMCP server:**\n\
    \n```python\nfrom typing import Any\nfrom mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP\n\n\
    # Initialize FastMCP server\nmcp = FastMCP(\"hello_world\")\n\n@mcp.tool()\nasync\
    \ def hello_world() -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    A simple tool that returns \"Hello,\
    \ world!\".\n    \"\"\"\n    return \"Hello, world!\"\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\"\
    :\n    # Initialize and run the server\n    mcp.run(transport='stdio')\n```\n\n\
    4.  **Run the server:**\n\n```bash\npython hello_world.py\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\
    \n*   The code initializes a FastMCP server named \"hello\\_world\".\n*   The\
    \ `@mcp.tool()` decorator registers the `hello_world` function as an available\
    \ tool.\n*   The `hello_world` function simply returns the string \"Hello, world!\"\
    .\n*   The `mcp.run(transport='stdio')` command starts the server and makes it\
    \ accessible to clients via standard input/output.\n\nThis example demonstrates\
    \ a basic MCP server setup. In real-world scenarios, MCP servers can be used to\
    \ integrate LLMs with a wide range of external services and applications.\n```"

    its problems, setup steps, and a "Hello World" example.


    I''ve already gathered information about MCP from previous steps, including summaries
    of `modelcontextprotocol.io` and a list of "Hello World" examples.


    Here''s the plan:


    1.  **Select a promising URL for a \"Hello World\" example and summarize it:**
    From the list of \"Hello World\" examples found via web search, I will select
    a promising-looking URL, then summarize the page using the `get_url_summary` tool.
    I will prioritize the URLs from `github.com`

    2.  **Analyze the summaries:** After summarizing the pages, I will analyze the
    content to extract information about MCP setup, problems it solves, setup steps,
    and example code.

    3.  **Compile the report:** Combine the information gathered into a detailed report,
    including setup steps, problems solved, and the "Hello World" example.

    4.  **Report the final answer:** Use the `report_final_answer` tool to submit
    the compiled report.

    Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server Report\n\n**What is MCP?**\n\nModel Context
    Protocol (MCP) is a protocol that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact
    with external tools and resources. It provides a standardized way for LLMs to
    access up-to-date information, perform actions beyond text generation, and dynamically
    adjust behavior based on real-time information.\n\n**Problems Solved by MCP:**\n\n*   **Limited
    Knowledge:** MCP allows LLMs to access current information, overcoming the limitations
    of their training data.\n*   **Lack of Functionality:** MCP enables LLMs to perform
    actions such as querying databases, interacting with APIs, and controlling external
    systems.\n*   **Static Context:** MCP enables LLMs to adapt their behavior based
    on real-time data and user input.\n\n**Setup Steps for an MCP Server:**\n\n1.  **Clone
    the repository:** Obtain the necessary code by cloning the repository (e.g., `TeamDman/mcp-server-hello`
    for a Rust-based hello-world server or `modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk` for the
    official Python SDK).\n2.  **Modify project information:** Customize the project
    details in the appropriate files (e.g., `Cargo.toml` for Rust projects or Python
    files for Python projects).\n3.  **Modify server handlers:** Implement the desired
    functionality by modifying the server handlers for prompts, resources, and tools.
    These handlers define how the server responds to requests from the LLM.\n4.  **Integrate
    with Claude for Desktop (optional):** To use the MCP server with Claude for Desktop,
    edit the `claude_desktop_config.json` file (accessible through Claude Desktop
    -> Settings -> Developer -> Edit Config). Add the configuration details for your
    MCP server.\n5.  **Check MCP logs:** Monitor the MCP server logs (e.g., using
    `tail -n 20 -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log`) to troubleshoot any issues.\n\n**Minimal
    "Hello World" MCP Example (Python):**\n\n```python\nfrom mcp.server import MCPServer\nfrom
    mcp.resource import Resource\n\nclass HelloResource(Resource):\n    async def
    get(self, request):\n        return "Hello, world!"\n\nserver = MCPServer()\nserver.add_resource("/hello",
    HelloResource())\n\nif __name__ == "__main__":\n    server.run(port=8000)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **Import
    necessary modules:** Imports the `MCPServer` and `Resource` classes from the `mcp.server`
    and `mcp.resource` modules, respectively.\n2.  **Create a Resource:** Create a
    resource named "HelloResource" that returns the string "Hello, world!" when requested
    by the agent.\n3.  **Create an MCP Server:** The server is created and the resource
    is added.\n4.  **Run the server:** The server is set to run on port 8000.\n\n**References:**\n\n*   MCP

    # Final Report: Simple Coding Agent in Docker with GitHub Access


    ## Introduction


    This report outlines the steps to create a minimal coding agent running inside
    a Docker container, with access to a forked GitHub repository. The goal is to
    provide a basic framework for experimentation and further development of more
    sophisticated coding agents.


    ## 1. Dockerfile Setup


    The Dockerfile will define the environment for our agent. Key considerations include:


    *   Base image: Use a lightweight Python base image (e.g., `python:3.9-slim-buster`).

    *   Dependencies: Install necessary Python packages (e.g., agent library, Git).

    *   SSH Key Setup: Securely add an SSH key to allow the container to access the
    GitHub repository. The specific commands for this will be detailed in the next
    section, based on the research.

    *   Code Copying: Copy the agent''s code into the container.

    *   Entrypoint: Define the command to start the agent.


    ```dockerfile

    #Example

    FROM python:3.9-slim-buster

    # Set working directory

    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy requirements file

    COPY requirements.txt .

    # Install dependencies

    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

    # Copy application code

    COPY . .

    #Command to start the agent.

    CMD ["python", "agent.py"]

    ```


    ## 2. GitHub Access Inside Docker


    Granting the Docker container access to the GitHub repository involves using SSH
    keys. This avoids storing passwords directly in the image. Here''s the process:


    *   **Generate SSH Key Pair:** Generate an SSH key pair specifically for the agent.
    The public key will be added to the GitHub repository''s deploy keys with write
    access (for pushing changes).

    *   **Add SSH Key to Container:** Add the private key to the Docker image securely.
    One method is to use multi-stage builds or environment variables, being careful
    not to expose the key in the final image layers. The Docker blog post suggests
    mounting the SSH keys as read-only, without modifying host configurations. I need
    to research more on that.

    *   **.gitconfig:** The .gitconfig file needs to be configured within the container
    to ensure proper user identification when committing changes.


    ## 3. Simple Agent Implementation


    The agent''s core loop involves:


    1.  **Observation:** Gathering information about the current state of the code
    repository (e.g., files, issues).

    2.  **Planning:** Formulating a plan based on the observation and the agent''s
    goals (e.g., fix a bug, add a feature).

    3.  **Action:** Executing the plan by modifying the code, committing changes,
    and pushing them to the GitHub repository.


    A very simple agent might just read the first line of a given file. It might also
    add a timestamp to a new file, and push to github. This would prove the agent
    can write and read and push.


    ## Conclusion


    This report provides a basic outline for creating a coding agent in Docker with
    GitHub access. Further research and development are needed to create more sophisticated
    and capable agents.

    \  The article discusses a secure way to use SSH private keys in Docker containers.\n\
    \n  Key points:\n\n  - **Problem:** Copying SSH keys into Docker containers is\
    \ a bad security practice. Even if removed later, they can still be accessible.\n\
    \  - **Solution:** Use SSH agent forwarding with the `--mount=type=ssh` option\
    \ within the `RUN` instruction. This allows the container to use the SSH key during\
    \ the build process without copying it into the image.\n  - **Docker version:**\
    \ Requires Docker 18.09 or later.\n  - **Steps:**\n    1.  Add the remote public\
    \ key to the container's `known_hosts` file:\n        ```bash\n        RUN mkdir\
    \ -p -m 0600 ~/.ssh && ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts\n        ```\n\
    \    2.  Mount the SSH socket while cloning the Git repository:\n        ```bash\n\
    \        RUN --mount=type=ssh git clone git@github.com:user/my_repo.git folder_name\n\
    \        ```\n    3.  Enable the system's default SSH socket usage at build stage,\
    \ specifying the key location, and declaring `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1` :\n        ```bash\n\
    \        export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1\n        docker build --ssh default=$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa\
    \ .\n        ```\n  - **Benefit:** The SSH key remains secured on the host system\
    \ and isn't copied into the container.\n  - **Usage:** The `--mount=type=ssh`\
    \ option can be used with any command that requires SSH access.\n```"

    \ build process utilizes the `--mount=type=ssh` argument to forward the SSH agent\
    \ connection from the host machine into the container during the build. This allows\
    \ `git clone` and other SSH operations to work without embedding the private key\
    \ in the image.  This requires Docker 18.09 or later and setting `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1`.\n\
    \n    ```bash\n    DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --ssh default=$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa\
    \ .\n    ```\n\n*   **.gitconfig:** The .gitconfig file needs to be configured\
    \ within the container to ensure proper user identification when committing changes.\
    \ This can be included as part of your application code that you copy into the\
    \ container.\n\n## 3. Simple Agent Implementation\n\nThe agent's core loop involves:\n\
    \n1.  **Observation:** Gathering information about the current state of the code\
    \ repository (e.g., files, issues).\n2.  **Planning:** Formulating a plan based\
    \ on the observation and the agent's goals (e.g., fix a bug, add a feature).\n\
    3.  **Action:** Executing the plan by modifying the code, committing changes,\
    \ and pushing them to the GitHub repository.\n\nA very simple agent might just\
    \ read the first line of a given file. It might also add a timestamp to a new\
    \ file and push to github. This would prove the agent can write, read, and push.\
    \ Here's a conceptual example:\n\n```python\n#agent.py\nimport os\nimport subprocess\n\
    from datetime import datetime\n\ndef read_first_line(filename):\n    with open(filename,\
    \ 'r') as f:\n        first_line = f.readline().strip()\n    return first_line\n\
    \ndef add_timestamp(filename):\n    timestamp = datetime.now().isoformat()\n \
    \   with open(filename, 'w') as f:\n        f.write(f\"Last updated: {timestamp}\\\
    n\")\n\ndef commit_and_push(message):\n    subprocess.run([\"git\", \"add\", \"\
    .\"], check=True)\n    subprocess.run([\"git\", \"commit\", \"-m\", message],\
    \ check=True)\n    subprocess.run([\"git\", \"push\"], check=True) #Ensure SSH\
    \ key is correctly configured for push access\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\
    \    # Example usage\n    filename = \"example.txt\"\n    if os.path.exists(filename):\n\
    \        content = read_first_line(filename)\n        print(f\"First line of {filename}:\
    \ {content}\")\n    else:\n        add_timestamp(filename)\n        print(f\"\
    {filename} created with timestamp.\")\n\n    commit_and_push(\"Automated update\
    \ by agent\")\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis report provides a basic outline for\
    \ creating a coding agent in Docker with GitHub access. Further research and development\
    \ are needed to create more sophisticated and capable agents. The key is to use\

    Final Report: Simple Coding Agent in Docker with GitHub Access\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis
    report outlines the steps to create a minimal coding agent running inside a Docker
    container, with access to a forked GitHub repository. The goal is to provide a
    basic framework for experimentation and further development of more sophisticated
    coding agents. We will focus on securely granting the Docker container access
    to the GitHub repository using SSH keys and agent forwarding, avoiding the storage
    of private keys directly within the image.\n\n## 1. Dockerfile Setup\n\nThe Dockerfile
    defines the environment for our agent. Key considerations include:\n\n*   Base
    image: Use a lightweight Python base image (e.g., `python:3.9-slim-buster`).\n*   Dependencies:
    Install necessary Python packages (e.g., agent library, Git).\n*   SSH Key Setup:
    Securely enable SSH access via agent forwarding, avoiding direct key storage.\n*   Code
    Copying: Copy the agent\''s code into the container.\n*   Entrypoint: Define the
    command to start the agent.\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM python:3.9-slim-buster\n\n#
    Set working directory\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Install Git\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get
    install -y git openssh-client\n\n# Copy requirements file\nCOPY requirements.txt
    .\n\n# Install dependencies\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt\n\n#
    Add github.com to known_hosts\nRUN mkdir -p -m 0600 ~/.ssh && ssh-keyscan github.com
    >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts\n\n# Copy application code\nCOPY . .\n\n#Command to start
    the agent.\nCMD ["python", "agent.py"]\n```\n\n## 2. GitHub Access Inside Docker\n\nGranting
    the Docker container access to the GitHub repository involves using SSH agent
    forwarding. This avoids storing passwords directly in the image.\n\n*   **SSH
    Agent Forwarding:**  The Docker build process utilizes the `--mount=type=ssh`
    argument to forward the SSH agent connection from the host machine into the container
    during the build. This allows `git clone` and other SSH operations to work without

    --ssh default=$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa .\n    ```\n\n*   **.gitconfig:** The .gitconfig
    file needs to be configured within the container to ensure proper user identification
    when committing changes. This can be included as part of your application code
