  question: 'I''m making a grocery list for my mom, but she''s a professor of botany
    and she''s a real stickler when it comes to categorizing things. I need to add
    different foods to different categories on the grocery list, but if I make a mistake,
    she won''t buy anything inserted in the wrong category. Here''s the list I have
    so far:


    milk, eggs, flour, whole bean coffee, Oreos, sweet potatoes, fresh basil, plums,
    green beans, rice, corn, bell pepper, whole allspice, acorns, broccoli, celery,
    zucchini, lettuce, peanuts


    I need to make headings for the fruits and vegetables. Could you please create
    a list of just the vegetables from my list? If you could do that, then I can figure
    out how to categorize the rest of the list into the appropriate categories. But
    remember that my mom is a real stickler, so make sure that no botanical fruits
    end up on the vegetable list, or she won''t get them when she''s at the store.
    Please alphabetize the list of vegetables, and place each item in a comma separated
    list.'

  question: 'Hi, I''m making a pie but I could use some help with my shopping list.
    I have everything I need for the crust, but I''m not sure about the filling. I
    got the recipe from my friend Aditi, but she left it as a voice memo and the speaker
    on my phone is buzzing so I can''t quite make out what she''s saying. Could you
    please listen to the recipe and list all of the ingredients that my friend described?
    I only want the ingredients for the filling, as I have everything I need to make
    my favorite pie crust. I''ve attached the recipe as Strawberry pie.mp3.


    In your response, please only list the ingredients, not any measurements. So if
    the recipe calls for "a pinch of salt" or "two cups of ripe strawberries" the
    ingredients on the list would be "salt" and "ripe strawberries".


    Please format your response as a comma separated list of ingredients. Also, please
    alphabetize the ingredients.'
